__name__ concept: 
__name__ is a special variable in Python that indicates how a file is being used. 
If the file is executed directly, __name__ is set to '__main__'. 
If the file is imported as a module, __name__ is set to the module's name (the filename without the .py extension). 
This allows Python files to be used both as reusable modules and as standalone programs

import UnderstadingNameA

print(f"[b.py] Valor de __name__: {__name__}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("[b.py] Ejecutado directamente")
else:
    print("[b.py] Importado como m√≥dulo")
